"""
Simple HTTP CONNECT proxy implemented with trio: https://trio.readthedocs.io

Tested with Python 3.6 and Trio 0.3.0.

Instructions:

#. In one terminal, run this script to start the proxy on port 8080:

       $ ./trio_http_proxy.py
       * Starting HTTP proxy on port 8080...

   (You can set the PORT env var to use a different port if you prefer.)

#. In another terminal, make an HTTPS request through the proxy, e.g.

       $ curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 https://canhazip.com

   You should get the response you were expecting from the destination server,
   and should see output in the first terminal about the forwarded data, e.g.

       [conn1] Got CONNECT request for canhazip.com
       [conn1] Connected to canhazip.com, sending 200 response...
       [conn1] Sent "200 Connection established" to client
       [conn1 -> canhazip.com] Forwarded 196 bytes
       [conn1 <- canhazip.com] Forwarded 2954 bytes
       ...

#. For even moar proxy amaze,
   configure your OS or web browser to use the proxy,
   and then try browsing to some HTTPS websites.
   It works! ğŸ’ª

   HTTP sites won't work because the proxy only handles HTTP CONNECT requests.
   But http is weak sauce anyways. ğŸ¤“

#. When you're done, just hit Ctrl+C to kill the server.
   Don't forget to restore any proxy settings you changed
   to how they were set before.
